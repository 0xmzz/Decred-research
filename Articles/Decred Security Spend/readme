Motivation:
Hybrid protocol that Decred Employs has greater deterrent properties to misuse than Pure PoW. 
This is because the attacker needs to gain a large portion of the stake in addition to hashpower 
to be able to make blocks faster than the rest of the network. The analysis aims to showcase this
greater security in a chart from the inception of the network till current date.

Goal:
Create a Webpage that shows the Security spend of decered on a chart. Then Build more functionality ontop, such as detecting double spends,
empty blocks and more complex attack costs.

Requirements:

python installed to create a .csv output 

The .CSV file from the script outputs the following columns:

Date	diff	height	sdiff	value	Close	Market Cap	Cost of 50% stake	Cost of 50% hashpower	total cost of attack/security spend
