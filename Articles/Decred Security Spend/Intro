Motivation:
Hybrid protocol that Decred Employs has greater deterrent properties to misuse than Pure PoW. 
This is because the attacker needs to gain a large portion of the stake in addition to hashpower 
to be able to make blocks faster than the rest of the network. The analysis aims to showcase this
greater security in a chart from the inception of the network till current date.

Goal:
Create a Webpage that shows the Security spend of decered on a chart. Then Build more functionality ontop, such as detecting double spends,
empty blocks and more complex attack costs.

Requirements:

Code (python or R) to create a .csv output and a full outter join of the two sources below:

1) Decred block data : https://explorer.dcrdata.org/api/block/1/(current block)
			i. API docs: https://github.com/decred/dcrdata#json-rest-api
			
		Data of importance:
		a) Block Height
		b) Date
		c) Difficulty (to calculate Hashpower)
		d) Sdiff (staking difficulty)
		e) Stake Pool Value
		
		
		
2) Price data : https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ 
			i. https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyQuotesHistorical
			Note* may webscrape this data
		
		Data of importance
		a) Date
		b) Close
			
			
	
Output .CSV file with the following columns

Block Height |	Date |	Difficulty |	Sdiff |	Stakepool Value | Closing Price | Cost to do a majority attack (Cost to get 50% Hashrate+ 50% of stakepool Value)|
