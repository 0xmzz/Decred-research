Teach​ us something.
● Spend 3-5 minutes teaching a process or explaining a concept.
● Teach something “from the middle of a course” - not an intro or overview: really get into
something specific.
● Remember to back up what you’re saying with engaging and instructional visuals. This is
video training, not an audio podcast.
● Tell us ‘why’ and ‘how’.
● Don’t just click through a series of steps. Explain why you make certain choices or
changes. Explain why it matters. Help your viewers understand the expertise and
reasoning behind your actions.
Present​ your content how you would in our studio.
● Avoid waving the mouse around.
● Practice your delivery so you don’t sound scripted.
● Be friendly, not formal. Imagine you’re sitting down next to someone at their computer,
not standing in front of 500 people.
Don’t edit ​your video.
● We need to see the un-edited version. We need to get an idea of how the editing
process might go.
● Everybody makes mistakes, so leave yours in the video.
Don’t​ ​worry​ about audio quality or video compression.
